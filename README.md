## Vue REST Countries API with color theme switcher

>The goal of the app is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs provided by [frontmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

>Users of the app should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
